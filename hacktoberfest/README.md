# Hacktoberfest @ IE

Dive into the world of open-source with Hacktoberfest at IE! We've set up a fun and engaging workshop for you to learn Git, contribute to open-source projects, and make the digital realm a better place. To kickstart this journey, we've chosen Open Interpreter to be your companion. Let's get you set up!

## Set Up [Open Interpreter](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/introduction)
Open Interpreter will make your Git experience a breeze throughout our workshops. Follow the steps below, and you'll be ready to contribute in no time!

### Pre-requisites
- Download and install the [latest stable version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to manage your Python packages.

### What is Open Interpreter?
Open Interpreter is an open-source tool that empowers you to execute code seamlessly on your machine with the aid of language models. It's your code buddy!

### Installation Steps
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Make sure pip is installed.
3. Run the following command to install Open Interpreter:
   ```bash
   pip install open-interpreter
   ```
4. Head over to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate an API key.

   ![API Key Generation](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/red-arrow-pointing-to-the-button-that-generates-a-new-API-key.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5)

   1. Hit the "Create New Secret Key" button.
   2. Name your key (e.g., open-interpreter).
   3. Copy the key and run the following command in your terminal:

      For Linux/MacOS:
      ```bash
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
      ```

      For Windows:
      ```bash
      set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
      ```

### Usage
Run the `interpreter` command in your terminal to launch Open Interpreter. Voila! You now have a natural-language interface for interactive coding.

## Contribute Like a Pro!
This guide equips you with resources and prompts for Open Interpreter to kickstart your open-source contribution journey.

1. We've set up a [practice repository](https://github.com/haxybaxy/testrepo) for you. Fork it to get started!
2. Clone the forked repository to your machine via Open Interpreter:
   ```plaintext
   Hey! I want to clone my forked repository. Here's the link: https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hacktobertest
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your modifications:
   ```plaintext
   I'd like to create a new branch named <my-new-branch>. Can you assist?
   ```
4. Modify the repository. Create new files or open existing ones in your favorite editor like so:
   ```plaintext
   Open the cloned repository in <my-favorite-editor>. I'd like to make some changes.
   ```
5. Commit and push your changes:
   ```plaintext
   I've made changes and am ready to commit and push with the message: <my first commit>
   ```
6. Create a pull request to the original repository:
   ```plaintext
   I'm ready to create a pull request. Please help me open it in my browser.
   ```
